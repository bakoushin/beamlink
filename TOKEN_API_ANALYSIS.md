# Token API Analysis & Recommendations

## Summary

After researching Jupiter's APIs and analyzing your current implementation, **your current choice of the Top Organic Score API is the best option for regular users**. I've enhanced it with additional safety filtering.

## API Comparison

### âœ… Current: Top Organic Score API (RECOMMENDED)

**Endpoint:** `https://lite-api.jup.ag/tokens/v2/toporganicscore/24h`

**Advantages:**

- **Quality Filtering Built-in**: Organic score filters tokens based on genuine trading activity, not wash trading
- **Comprehensive Metadata**: Includes everything needed for informed decisions:
  - Token audit information (mint/freeze authority status)
  - Holder metrics and changes
  - Trading statistics across multiple timeframes (5m, 1h, 6h, 24h)
  - Price, market cap, FDV, liquidity
  - Verification status and community tags
- **Pre-ranked**: Tokens are already sorted by quality score
- **User Safety Focus**: Built-in metrics help identify potentially risky tokens
- **Rich Data**: Includes organic buyer counts, net buyer metrics, and more

**Best For:** Regular users who need a curated list of quality tokens

---

### Alternative: Jupiter Token List API

**Endpoint:** Available through Jupiter MCP Server's `get_token_list` tool

**Advantages:**

- Comprehensive list of all tradeable tokens
- Good for advanced users who want maximum choice

**Disadvantages:**

- No quality filtering - includes all tokens (high-risk and low-risk)
- Requires manual filtering and safety checks
- Can overwhelm regular users with too many options
- Higher risk of scam tokens without proper filtering

**Best For:** Advanced users or developers who need complete token coverage

---

### Alternative: Jupiter Token Metadata API

**Endpoint:** Available through Jupiter MCP Server's `get_token_metadata` tool

**Use Case:** Individual token lookups, not suitable for getting a list of popular tokens

---

## Implemented Safety Enhancements

I've added client-side filtering to make your token list even safer for regular users:

### Safety Filters Applied:

1. **Verified Tokens Auto-Pass**: All verified tokens are automatically included
2. **Mint Authority Check**: Ensures mint authority is disabled (prevents unlimited token printing)
3. **Freeze Authority Check**: Ensures freeze authority is disabled (prevents freezing user funds)
4. **Holder Concentration**: Limits top holder percentage to < 50% (reduces rug pull risk)
5. **Minimum Holders**: Requires at least 100 holders (ensures established tokens)

### Code Changes:

**File:** `src/queries/tokens.ts`

- Added `filterSafeTokens()` function
- Automatically filters tokens before returning to the UI
- Well-documented safety criteria

**File:** `src/TokenSelector.tsx`

- Added verification badge (blue checkmark) for verified tokens
- Helps users quickly identify trusted tokens

---

## Why This Approach is Best for Regular Users

### 1. **Multi-Layer Protection**

- Jupiter's organic score (API-level filtering)
- Your custom safety filters (app-level filtering)
- Visual verification indicators (UI-level trust signals)

### 2. **User-Friendly**

- Pre-filtered to quality tokens only
- Clear visual indicators of verified status
- Reduces decision paralysis with curated selection

### 3. **Robust Data**

- Real-time trading metrics
- Comprehensive audit information
- Multiple timeframe statistics for trend analysis

### 4. **Performance**

- Single API call gets all needed data
- Client-side filtering is fast
- 24-hour cache reduces API load

---

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### CoinGecko / CoinMarketCap APIs

**Pros:**

- Very established and reliable
- Comprehensive cross-chain data
- Good documentation

**Cons:**

- Requires API key for good rate limits
- Not Solana-specific
- Less real-time trading data
- May not include newer Solana tokens
- Additional API dependency

**Verdict:** Not recommended for your use case since Jupiter's API is purpose-built for Solana and provides better real-time data

---

## Future Enhancements to Consider

### 1. **User Preference Toggle**

```typescript
// Allow users to toggle between "Safe Mode" and "All Tokens"
const [safeMode, setSafeMode] = useState(true);
```

### 2. **Risk Indicators**

Show risk levels for unverified tokens based on audit data:

- ðŸŸ¢ Low Risk (verified or passes all checks)
- ðŸŸ¡ Medium Risk (passes most checks)
- ðŸ”´ High Risk (fails multiple checks)

### 3. **Favorite Tokens**

Allow users to save favorite tokens for quick access

### 4. **Token Watchlist**

Let users create custom watchlists with price alerts

---

## Conclusion

**Stick with the Top Organic Score API** - it's the best balance of:

- Safety (organic score filtering)
- Usability (pre-ranked quality tokens)
- Completeness (comprehensive metadata)
- Performance (single endpoint, rich data)

The safety enhancements I've added make it even more robust for regular users while maintaining the benefits of Jupiter's quality filtering.

---

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Verify Filtering Works**: Check that only safe tokens appear in the list
2. **Test Verification Badge**: Confirm verified tokens show the blue checkmark
3. **Monitor Token Count**: Track how many tokens pass the filters vs. total
4. **User Feedback**: Gather feedback on whether the token selection feels appropriate
